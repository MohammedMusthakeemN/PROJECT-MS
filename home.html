<b><p>The placement cell facilitates students to explore career options and guides them in identifying potential employers that match their interests, strengths and skill set. Case studies, real-life projects, group discussions, interactions with industry experts and alumni, all form part of this programme and go a long way in preparing students for placements.

 

The placement team takes the initiative to explore career avenues through visits to companies in a wide range of sectors. The selection process starts with a pre-placement talk by the recruiting organization, where the students are given insights on the company, job profile and career progression. This is then followed by the selection procedure adopted by the respective recruiter.</P>
