Libraries
You certainly won’t be short of libraries at MEASI– the collegiate University has more than 100! Libraries provide study spaces, resources and staff to help you find what you need for your studies.<br>

College libraries contain standard course texts and other related materials, as well as some specialist collections.<br>
Faculty and department libraries offer more specialised subject collections and can signpost you to subject-specific electronic resources, including journals, ebooks and databases.<br>
The main University Library (or UL) is a legal deposit library holding more than eight million books, journals and other documents ranging in age from ancient manuscripts to a vast range of electronic resources available for you to access from anywhere.<br>
To ensure you get the most from the University’s libraries, the UL and many of the College, faculty and department libraries offer practical sessions and one-to-one help. These include introductory tours, sessions to highlight the resources available for particular disciplines and information skills classes.<br>

The CamGuides pre-arrival resource will also introduce you to some of the academic, research and digital practices in which Measi students engage.<br>

For further information, visit Measi Libraries.<br>
